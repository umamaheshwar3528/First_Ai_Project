* Reduced costs through optimized resource allocation

## Open Policy Agent (OPA): Enforcing Complex Policies and Permissions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

OPA is an open-source policy engine that integrates with Kubernetes to enforce complex policies and permissions at runtime. This provides a more secure and compliant environment for organizations.

### Benefits of OPA

OPA provides several benefits, including:

* Improved security through enforced policies and permissions
* Simplified management and deployment of policies
* Reduced costs through optimized resource allocation

## Kubernetes Distribution: Available Distributions in 2025
----------------------------------------------------------

As of 2025, there are several Kubernetes distributions available, including Canonical's distribution (Ubuntu), Red Hat OpenShift, and SUSE Rancher, among others.

### Benefits of Different Distributions

Different Kubernetes distributions provide several benefits, including:

* Improved support for specific use cases or industries
